## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been
   reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the
   latest `master` or development branch in the repository.

3. **Isolate the problem** &mdash; make sure that the code in the repository is
_definitely_ responsible for the issue.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more
information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report.
